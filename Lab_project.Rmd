top_10_names
```
`a.	What does the above code chunk do?
The code performs the following actions:

1. **Selecting Popular Pet Names:**
   - It filters the `animal_name` column in the `seattlepets` data frame to include only rows where the pet's name is one of the specified names: ("Lucy", "Charlie", "Luna", "Bella", "Max", "Daisy", "Molly", "Jack", "Lily", "Stella").

2. **Creating a New Data Frame:**
   - The filtered result is stored in a new data frame called `top_10_names`.

In summary, the code filters the `seattlepets` data frame to include only the rows with the ten specified pet names and stores this filtered data in `top_10_names`.


`b. Plot the counts of the pet names (animal_name) in top_10_names
```{r}
seattlepets %>%
  filter(animal_name %in% c( "Lucy"  , "Charlie" , "Luna" , "Bella" , "Max"    , 
                           "Daisy" , "Molly"   , "Jack" , "Lily"  , "Stella" )) %>%
  ggplot(aes(animal_name , 
             fill = species)) + 
  geom_bar()
```

`The below code plots the proportion of dogs with a given name versus the proportion of cats with the same name. The 20 most common cat and dog names are displayed. The diagonal line on the plot is the x = y line; if a name appeared on this line, the nameâ€™s popularity would be exactly the same for dogs and cats.

`What names are more common for cats than dogs? The ones above the line or the ones below the line?

`Answer here..................
 **The names listed below the line are more common for cats than for dogs.**


`Is the relationship between the two variables (proportion of cats with a given name and proportion of dogs with a given name) positive or negative? What does this mean in context of the data?

`Answer here .............
**The relationship between the two variables is positive, meaning that as the proportion of cats with a given name increases, the proportion of dogs with the same name also tends to increase.**
